Graceful degradation starts with max technology, such as being able to access requests via the internet, then addresses the lower levels with grace. One way to address the lower levels with grace is by being able to refer back to the requests accessed via internet in case of an event where there is no longer internet. This is done by service workers which make it so a webpage can refer back to requests without internet. In this way graceful degredation and service workers are related as service workers allow the adressing of lower levels "with grace" when there is no longer access to "max technology."
